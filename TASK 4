The project that I chose was Robotic arm.The reason I find this project interesting is because robotics arms are a great 
technology that are being vastly used in today's manufacturing industries, medical industries etc.Building a robotic arm 
is a very challenging project as it includes kinematics ,programming ,control system etc.I would be thrilled
not only to learn those stuff but also be able apply them in building a robo arm.The learning values of this project are 
very useful in robotics hence i chose this projects.
