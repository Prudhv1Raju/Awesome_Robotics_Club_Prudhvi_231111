Explanation of the code

Use of numpy library for program
Starting with the distance calculation using numpy's
np.linalg.norm() to calculate the distance of the point

constrain angle function checks if the joint angle is within the given range


In fabrik algo code

target: The desired target position that the end effector of the robotic arm should reach.
joint_positions: The initial positions of the joints of the robotic arm.
joint_lengths: The lengths of the links between the joints.
tolerance: The acceptable tolerance for the difference between the final position of the end effector and the target position.
max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations to perform.
The algorithm iterates between forward and backward reaching steps until the end effector reaches the target position or the 
maximum number of iterations is reached.
In forward reaching step, it updates the joint positions based on the target position.
In backward reaching step, it adjusts the joint positions to satisfy the link lengths.

user input is stored in form of target_x target_y and target_z

the joint lenghts are 23 15 and 1

the fabrik function is called and processes the result

if the target is reachable then the optimal angles(radians) and joint positions are printed
if the target is unreachable then "target unreachable" is printed
